    "A stellar model is a set of computer programs that calculates the interior structure of a star. It does this by integrating the stellar structure equations to calculate the radius, luminosity, pressure, and temperature across a range of mass points from the centre of a star to its surface. For a star with a given mass and composition there is one unique solution for these equations.\n",

If you are already comfortable with python, you may use this code or develop your own version that you like better.\n",
